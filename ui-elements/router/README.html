<h1 id="router">Router</h1>
<p>The router requires a server-side component because of the deeplinking. In order to get that to work, you should clone the repo and do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the project.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python">Google App Engine SDK For Python</a>.</li>
<li>Run the SDK app to create symlinks.</li>
<li>Add it to the GAE Launcher you downloaded (Existing app, (Ctrl|Cmd)+Shift+N, /path/to/router).</li>
<li>Enjoy your local version of the router sample, probably at <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>.</li>
</ol>
