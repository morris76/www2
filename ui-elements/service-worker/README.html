<h1 id="service-worker">Service-Worker</h1>
<p>This is a service-worker for our server-side-rendering session.</p>
<p>Run <code>npm install</code> to install all dependencies and run the server with <code>node index.js</code>.
Start Chrome Canary using <code>npm run chrome</code>, since HTTP/2 and ServiceWorker development
on localhost doesnâ€™t play nicely currently.</p>
