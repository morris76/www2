<h1 id="code-splitting">Code Splitting</h1>
<p>This is mostly the code from the <code>server-side-rendering</code> sample. We have added <code>build.js</code> to perform code splitting and
route-based chunking.</p>
<p>Run <code>npm install</code> to install all dependencies. Run <code>node build.js</code> and then run the server with <code>node index.js</code>.</p>
