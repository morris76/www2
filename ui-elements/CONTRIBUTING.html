<h2 id="contributor-license-agreements">Contributor License Agreements</h2>
<p>We&#39;d love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.</p>
<p>Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are an individual writing original source code and you&#39;re sure you own the intellectual property, then you&#39;ll need to sign an <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual">individual CLA</a>.</li>
<li>If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you&#39;ll need to sign a <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate">corporate CLA</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we&#39;ll be able to
accept your pull requests.</p>
