<h1 id="ui-elements">UI Elements</h1>
<p>A collection of UI element samples written with vanilla web platform features.</p>
<p><strong>Please note: these are prototypes, and not production-ready. The aim is to demonstrate a solid approach for building performant UI elements.</strong></p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h2 id="es2015-and-es5-transpilation">ES2015 and ES5 Transpilation</h2>
<p>Please note: these samples are written in ES2015 and, as such, require <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">direct browser support</a>. You can transpile the examples with <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/">BabelJS</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">babel --presets=es2015 swipeable-cards/cards.js --out-file swipeable-cards/cards-es5.js
babel --presets=es2015 side-nav/side-nav.js --out-file side-nav/side-nav-es5.js
</code></pre>
<p>But to keep things as simple as possible for everyone, that&#39;s out of scope for this set of samples.</p>
