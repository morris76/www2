										<p>Dear CSCU Community,</p>

										<p>Since becoming President, it has become clear to me and our Board of Regents that the current structure of our system is not viable in the long term. In 2011, our system was consolidated to leverage our collective talent and ensure the continued access, affordability, and student success that our institutions deliver. For a variety of reasons, we have not realized the power that comes with developing a system in which interrelated and interdependent entities come together around a common goal.&nbsp; I believe the time is now to fully embrace the potential of our system.</p>
										
										<p>Over the last several years because Connecticut is facing serious fiscal difficulties, our state funding has declined by 12.4%. Forty one percent (41%) of our total revenue comes from state appropriations which for the community colleges is 60% of their overall funding. We are facing at least a $35 million decrease for the next fiscal year and that assumes $700 million in from labor savings. &nbsp;These reductions follow successive years of budget cuts, rescissions, lapses, and holdbacks that have eaten away at the state revenues that fund our institutional missions.</p>

					<div class="toggle">
						<a class="button">Read More</a>
					</div>
					<div class="content">

						<p>Every year the leadership at our schools has struggled to balance their individual budgets. Our institutions have few areas to trim expenses given that 80% of our total spending is dedicated to personnel costs and 95% of our fulltime staff is represented by bargaining units. &nbsp;&nbsp;It has become abundantly clear that our operational costs are outpacing our revenues creating a true structural deficit.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Cutting costs has helped the system to address immediate budget shortfalls but these strategies will not lead to long-term sustainability. Further, these cuts have reduced student services that they need to succeed.&nbsp; We have asked students to bear a portion of the cost of their education through tuition and fee increases, but we cannot charge them the double digit increases required to balance the budget without compromising affordability.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>So today, we find ourselves facing enormous challenges.&nbsp; For these reasons, I was charged by the Board of Regents to develop a management plan to put our system on a predictable and sustainable path for the future. Now is the time to make tough decisions that will involve difficult choices and change is always hard. We need to look at our organization and determine how it can be reconfigured to ensure that resources are focused on teaching and learning and we're putting our students first.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>We have to ask ourselves, are we really serving our students well if we continue to make cuts each year? Does it really make sense to continue "business as usual" and risk the high quality learning our students expect and deserve? Aren't we doing a disservice to our state if we don't preserve academic excellence and prepare our students for the competitive workforce that awaits them? How can we improve graduation and retention rates if we aren't spending vital resources on student services?</p>

						<p>The overall guiding principle in our deliberations has been keeping Students First; meaning that students are at the center of any proposed strategies; that teaching, learning and high quality academic programs are prioritized; and that student support services are preserved and enhanced. We cannot balance our budget on the backs of our students nor can we continue incremental cost cutting that only limits our long term success.</p>

						<p>Therefore, I am recommending to the Board two strategies for immediate implementation. The first is an administrative consolidation across all institutions and system office of non-student facing/administrative personnel. &nbsp;&nbsp;I am proposing integrating operations such as IT, Human Resources, Purchasing and Contracts, Facilities and other "back office" functions. The target savings of this recommended strategy is approximately $13 million. This will eliminate redundancies across our campuses, leverage the expertise of our talented staff, and allow better coordination and consistency of non-student facing activities.</p>

						<p>This integration starts with pooling the talent currently spread across our institutions statewide both virtually and on campuses. For instance, institutional research which provides analysis of both individual campus and aggregate system trends will benefit from tapping into the expertise of staff system wide rather than limiting their focus to individual campuses. In human resources, staff can be pooled not just to provide daily support on our campuses but to share their expertise in labor relations, hiring and promotion and disciplinary actions with their sister institutions.&nbsp; A restructured system office can coordinate functions centrally while administrative staff will conduct daily campus activities.</p>

						<p>Secondly, I am proposing an operational consolidation of our 12 community colleges into one that is centrally managed and maintains the unique mission, geographic locations and local community connections. This will require a phased in approach for the consolidation of leadership and management. The savings target for this recommendation is approximately $28 million. &nbsp;This strategy calls for the significant reduction of campus leadership and management in addition to the administrative consolidation called for in the first recommendation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

						<p>What I am proposing to you today is the first step towards a sustainable path forward. To be clear, reductions in faculty and student-facing functions such as advisors are not included in either of these strategies. &nbsp;And when resources are saved through these proposed strategies, we can reinvest them in faculty and staff who facilitate student engagement and success.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>As I have said repeatedly, all options have been on the table. We examined the closing of community college campuses and the operational consolidation of our universities. We looked at regional consolidation of the universities and colleges and elimination of system office. Those options did not meet our guiding principles, were not feasible for long-term growth, or were potentially more costly.</p>

						<p>That said I want to be very clear. We are currently operating on the assumption that for the next fiscal year we will have a decrease in state funding of at least $35 million. If however, there is no SEBAC agreement and our deficit increases, we will have to revisit and possibly adopt those strategies.</p>

						<p>Though I am not proposing the consolidation of our universities and colleges, I want us to look for potential regional partnerships between our universities and our colleges. Are there ways they can collaborate on academic programming or student engagement?&nbsp; I want us to look at ways to leverage our online institution, Charter Oak and see if there are ways to better serve our students.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>In order to move forward with these options, I will create implementation teams for specific areas. Building a sustainable organizational model will be a monumental task, but a critical one for our system's future. These are difficult decisions, where absolutely nothing was taken lightly. But I truly believe we have a responsibility to our students and our talented staff to preserve the high quality learning environment that is unique to our institutions. Doing nothing is not an option. Our system as it is will not survive. Our institutions deserve the opportunity to grow and be even greater than they are today but with a stable sustainable future.</p>

						<p>I want to personally thank all of our CSCU students and their families for investing in their education and our system. Now it is our turn to directly address our challenges and position our system for a stable future. By doing so, we can continue to provide affordable, innovative and rigorous programs and services that allow our students to achieve their personal and career goals and continue providing the educational experiences they deserve.</p>

						<p>Sincerely,<br>

					<p>Dear CSCU Community,
					
					<p>The Students First planning process is now underway!  The administrative consolidation planning teams will begin their work immediately and I look forward to engaging in their discussions throughout the summer.  
					
					<p>The six administrative teams have been assembled with representatives selected by the collective bargaining units and constituent unit leadership groups as well as faculty and staff volunteers and subject matter experts from the campuses and System Office.  We anticipate additional individuals may be added to the teams as the work progresses to add expertise.  The charge to each team is to identify a sustainable structure for providing these services to the campuses while leveraging and optimizing both human and financial resources. 
					
					<p>In addition to the six administrative teams, a community college consolidation team, led by President Michael Rooke from Northwestern Community College and comprised of the twelve community college presidents has been formed to propose a new structure under one centrally managed college.  A subcommittee of the presidents and deans of administration and academic and student affairs will fine tune the model to ensure it both meets the needs of individual campuses as well as NEASC and other professional program accrediting bodies.  

					<p>I am happy to share the webpage http://www.ct.edu/studentsfirst that we've created to house the information on the planning process.  You will find the listing of the administrative planning team members as well as members of the Steering Committee, Community College Consolidation committee and subcommittee.  I am working with the Student Advisory Committee to identify students to participate in this effort as well.  
					
					<p>As the teams conduct their work, notes from their meetings will be posted to the site as well as all messages I send out about the process.  You will also find a FAQ on this page and links to videos from some of the town hall meetings.  
					
					<p>Though the teams couldn't accommodate all who were interested, I want to thank all of you who volunteered and I continue to welcome your thoughts and ideas by email to <a href='mailto:CSCU-President@ct.edu'>CSCU-President@ct.edu</a>.  Additionally I will provide an opportunity for system-wide feedback on the draft recommendations before they are presented to the Board of Regents so that all who are interested can weigh in their suggestions and concerns.  

					<p>Again thank you all for your engagement in this process.  I am confident together we can keep students first.

						<p>Dear CSCU community,</p>

						<p>I am writing today to provide a brief update on the Students First planning process.  We are busy forming teams in six key areas to design and implement the administrative consolidation strategy.  Many of you have reached out to volunteer and the Community College Governance Assembly and labor unions representing the community colleges, SUOAF and the CSU Faculty Leadership Group are identifying representatives to serve in addition to subject matter experts from the campuses and system office.  We will make an announcement on the teams in early May after all the recommendations have been received. </p>

						<p>In addition, I mentioned that I would be forming a Steering Committee to join me in reviewing all recommendations and savings projections from the teams.  I am pleased to report that the following individuals have agreed to serve on the Steering Committee:</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>President Joe Bertolino, Southern CT State University</li>
								<li>President Zulma Toro, Central CT State University</li>
								<li>President Jim Lombella, Asnuntuck Community College</li>
								<li>President Paul Broadie, Housatonic Community College</li>
								<li>Holly Palmer, BOR Student Advisory Committee Chair</li>
								<li>Dan Barrett, Western CT State University, Faculty Senate Chair</li>
								<li>Michael Buccilli, Gateway Community College, Director of Counseling and Student Services</li>
							</ul>

						<p>Lastly, I am pleased to announce that President Mike Rooke has agreed to lead the effort on the community college consolidation strategy working closely with the presidents and management of the colleges.  That work is getting underway as we speak and there will be future opportunities for campus community feedback into that planning process as well. </p>

						<p>I hope to see many of you at the upcoming Town Halls.  The input we've received from the 6 sessions held to date has been very helpful and we look forward to hearing your ideas about how to make our system the best it can be.</p>

						<p>Dear CSCU Community,</p>

						<p>Last week I recommended to the Board of Regents two management strategies to help address our system's fiscal challenges.  One strategy is consolidation of administrative functions and the other is an organizational consolidation for our community colleges.  The Board approved both strategies along with the savings target for each.  These strategies are intended to deal with our structural deficit which only increases in the next few years and threatens the affordability and accessibility of our institutions. </p>

						<p>As I've learned from my first Town Hall meetings, there is significant uncertainty and some confusion about the strategies.  So first, I would like to provide some clarification.  The consolidation will integrate administrative, not instructional or student support, functions across all institutions as well as the system office to eliminate redundancies and ultimately run more efficiently.  The target savings of this recommended strategy is approximately $13 million.  The second approved strategy is an operational consolidation of leadership and management of our 12 community colleges. The savings target for this recommendation is approximately $28 million.  To be clear, reductions in faculty and staff that directly serve students are not included in either of these strategies and no campuses or student support or academic programs are being closed.   </p>

						<p>I believe these strategies support our common goal of providing our students with the high quality learning experience they need and deserve. It is a critical step to putting our system on a sustainable and predictable path forward and ultimately enhances teaching, learning and the high quality academic programs we provide our students.  </p>   

						<p>Now our attention turns to the important work of finalizing the design of "Students First" and initiating its implementation.  To move forward with these strategies, I am establishing implementation teams for specific administrative areas: Fiscal Affairs, Facilities, Human Resources, Information Technology, Institutional Research, and Financial Aid Processing.   Shortly I will be announcing the creation of a separate implementation team to address the community college management consolidation.  </p>

						<p>Each team will be led by a system office manager in the selected functional area with teams made up of subject matter experts from the campuses.  In addition, members, either elected or nominated representing the faculty, professional staff and other campus employees, will be invited to participate.</p>   

						<p>The teams will be charged to assess the current organizational structure, inventory campus activities, ascertain staff skills available through the system, identify technology supports needed to facilitate streamlining of processes, and document opportunities to integrate functions.   I will establish a Steering Committee representing college and university presidents to join me in reviewing all recommendations and savings projections from the teams.   </p>

						<p>The process for each implementation team will be shared on this website including: </p>
							<ul> 
								<li>written documents that include the charge, meeting procedures, and schedule, </li>
								<li>list of members, </li>
								<li>meeting times, dates and locations, and;</li>
								<li>meeting minutes. </li>
							</ul>
							
						<p>Individuals are encouraged to provide their suggestions to <a href='mailto:CSCU-President@ct.edu'>CSCU-President@ct.edu</a>.   Your input as CSCU community members will be critical to designing this plan and helping to move the system forward. </p>

						<p>The work of each team will start immediately with members identified and recommended to my office and meetings starting in April.  An implementation framework and timeline will be presented to the Board of Regents by their June meeting so we will be working as quickly as possible to get each team established.   </p>

						<p>As I said in my open letter to the CSCU community last week, building a sustainable organizational model will be a monumental task, but a critical one for our system's future.  But we must act now in order to thrive in the future. </p>

						<p>Thank you in advance for your hard work and support.  Together we can give our institutions the opportunity to grow and be even greater than they are today with a stable financial future.</p>

						<p>Sincerely,</p>
